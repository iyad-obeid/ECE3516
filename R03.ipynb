    "The goal of this week's assignment is to express each of the following signals as sums of sines and cosines. For each signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the main period, the main frequency in Hertz, and the main frequency in rads/sec\n",
    "- Write an expression for the frequency (in rads/sec) of the nth harmonic frequency\n",
    "- Solve for coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ such that $x(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\cos(\\omega_n t) + b_n\\sin(\\omega_n t)$\n",
    "- Prove that your coefficients are correct using a loop to sum over many values of $n$ and plotting the resulting signal. It should look similar to $x(n)$.\n",
    "- Solve for the coefficient $A_n$ such that $x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2|A_n|\\cos(\\omega_n t + \\angle A_n)$\n",
    "- Again prove your coefficients are correct by using a loop to sum over many values of $n$ and plotting the resulting signal.\n",
    "- Plot the magnitude and phase of $A_n$ as a function of frequency $f_n$\n",
