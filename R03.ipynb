    "## Week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this week's assignment is to express each of the following signals as sums of sines and cosines. For each signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the main period, the main frequency in Hertz, and the main frequency in rads/sec\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write an expression for the frequency (in rads/sec) of the nth harmonic frequency\n",
    "- Solve for coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ such that $x(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\cos(\\omega_n t) + b_n\\sin(\\omega_n t)$\n",
    "- Prove that your coefficients are correct using a loop to sum over many values of $n$ and plotting the resulting signal. It should look similar to $x(n)$.\n",
    "- Solve for the coefficient $A_n$ such that $x(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2|A_n|\\cos(\\omega_n t + \\angle A_n)$\n",
    "- Again prove your coefficients are correct by using a loop to sum over many values of $n$ and plotting the resulting signal.\n",
    "- Plot the magnitude and phase of $A_n$ as a function of frequency $f_n$\n",

    "### Bonus\n",
    "For bonus points, repeat the above steps for Signals 3 and 4\n",

    "### Signal 3\n",

    "### ECG Filtering\n",
    "Last week, you built a simple RC circuit with a cutoff frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will build on this by designing an RC filter to filter out the noise in the ECG signal from the file\n",
    "[`ecg_data.txt`](./files/ecg_data.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get checked off do and show the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the buffer option in the signal generator in Scopy to load the `ecg_data.txt` file and view it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the spectrum analyzer to locate where the noise is in the signal (it will be a large peak). We will call this fnoise. It is less than 200 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a filter to filter out this noise. You should include a potentiometer so you can change your cutoff frequency in real time (your cutoff should at least be adjustable to the range fnoise-50Hz to fnoise). Make sure to stay within your current limits of scopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show your results with both the spectrum analyzer and the oscilloscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be prepared to answer the questions: What cutoff frequency do you think gives the best EKG output? How did you design your circuit?"
