    "Project 2 is an extention of the Week 3 Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 3, you built a simple RC circuit to try filtering 60Hz noise from an EKG signal. The RC filter was a simple but poor choice for filtering. In this project we'll build a better filter by double or triple filtering the signal (second or third order filtering). You will design a circuit, simulate it in Multisim, and build it on your breadboard. Follow these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1** Use the `myFFT.py` function to study the frequency content of the EKG data and determine what you think a good filter cutoff frequency would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2** Create the _transfer function_ for a second order lowpass filter with the cutoff frequency determined in Step 1. I recommend using\n",
    "either the `butter` or `cheby1` functions in `SciPy`. The transfer function is just the mathematical description of a theoretical filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3** Design a physical circuit that will embody the filter that you planned out in Step 2. You should use the circuit architecture shown here. \n",

    "**What to Turn In:** This will be a check-off style project. You'll show me your code and I'll ask your a series of questions to see how well you understand your own work."
